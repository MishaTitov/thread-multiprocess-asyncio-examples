## Threading
Some info from ChatGPT:
Threading in Python, like any other form of concurrency, has both pros and cons. Here are some potential advantages and disadvantages of using threads:

Pros:

Concurrent execution: Threading allows you to execute multiple tasks concurrently, which can improve performance and reduce latency in your applications.

Responsiveness: Using threads can help keep your application responsive by allowing it to continue processing input or handling other tasks while a long-running operation is executed in the background.

Resource sharing: Threads can share resources such as memory and file handles, which can reduce resource usage and improve efficiency.

Simplified code: Threading can simplify your code by allowing you to write sequential code that executes concurrently, rather than having to manage multiple processes or use more complex concurrency models.

Flexibility: Threading provides a flexible and lightweight way to implement concurrency in your applications, making it easier to experiment with different concurrency models and patterns.

Cons:

Synchronization issues: When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, it can lead to synchronization issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks.

Overhead: Creating and managing threads can have some overhead, which can slow down the overall performance of your program.

Limited scalability: The performance gains from using threads can be limited by factors such as the number of available CPU cores, the size of the workloads, and the efficiency of the code.

Global interpreter lock (GIL): In CPython, the global interpreter lock (GIL) prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously on the same CPU core. This means that in some cases, the performance benefits of threading may be limited.

Debugging and testing: Debugging and testing concurrent code can be more difficult than sequential code, and concurrency issues may be harder to reproduce and diagnose.

Complexity: Concurrency adds a layer of complexity to your code, and may require additional design and testing to ensure correctness and robustness.

Despite these potential disadvantages, threading can still be a powerful tool for improving performance and concurrency in your Python programs, especially in cases where the overhead and synchronization issues can be managed effectively. It's important to carefully consider your use case and the potential trade-offs before deciding to use threading.

Threads are recommended to use when you need to execute multiple tasks concurrently within a single process. Here are some examples where threading can be useful:

I/O-bound operations: When performing I/O-bound operations such as network requests, file I/O, or database queries, threading can help to keep the application responsive by allowing other tasks to continue executing while the I/O operation is blocked.

Parallel processing: When performing CPU-bound operations such as image processing, data analysis, or scientific simulations, threading can help to utilize multiple CPU cores and improve performance.

GUI programming: When developing GUI applications, threading can help to keep the user interface responsive by allowing long-running operations to execute in the background.

Server programming: When building server applications such as web servers, threading can help to handle multiple client requests concurrently, improving scalability and responsiveness.

Real-time applications: When building real-time applications such as video streaming or gaming, threading can help to ensure timely delivery of data by allowing multiple tasks to execute concurrently.

It's important to note that threading is not always the best solution for concurrency, and in some cases, other concurrency models such as multiprocessing or asynchronous programming may be more appropriate. Additionally, threading requires careful consideration of synchronization and race conditions to ensure correct and reliable operation.
